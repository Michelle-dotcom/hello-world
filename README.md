Project:
Calendar programme to be used on a RasPi with Touchscreen.

The goal is to make calendar with different "layers":
- Public accessable - normal calendar
- Layer with sensitive data encrypted and protected by password or pin. To be used for example for sports or food or health diary.
- Option to run statistics on the data in the 2nd layer
- User can be sure that his/her data is protected and not shared
